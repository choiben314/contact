# Players may either create a room or join an existing room.
# A game is started after at least three players have joined a room.
# The wordmaster may either be randomly chosen, or someone may elect to fill this position.
# The wordmaster then must choose and submit a word.
# The first letter of this word is revealed to all players. 
# Players may now suggest a clue for a word that begins with the letter that has been revealed. 
# Up to one clue may be suggested at a time, along with the word that is being clued (hidden from everyone except themselves). 
# Players may also choose to retract their suggestion and suggest a different clue/word.
# If another player feels that they know what word is being clued, they may indicate CONTACT with the suggested clue and submit their guessed word.
# All other suggestions are now suspended, and the wordmaster must submit a word before the timer runs out (default: 10 seconds).
# While the timer is running out, other players may also indicate CONTACT and submit their guesses.
# Once the wordmaster submits a guess, or the timer runs out, all CONTACT submissions are revealed.
# If the wordmaster's guess matches any of the submissions, then no additional letters of the wordmaster's word are revealed.
# If the wordmaster's guess does not match any submissions, and any two of CONTACT submissions match, then the next letter of the wordmaster's word is revealed.
# This is repeated until someone suggests a clue for a word that is in fact the wordmaster's word.
